# Arduino Auto-Irrigation System

## I. Introduction

In this fast-paced world of rapid technological advancements and breakthroughs happening every day, we, human beings, prefer everything automated and easy. From cultivating crops to attempting to conquer space, we rely on technology all because of its past conquests, contributing to make our life easier.
Understanding the need and application of technology in today’s world our group has come up with a concept contributing to exonerate the farmers and cultivators from the usual burden they face in their area of work: agriculture, due to irrigation.  Irrigation, in simple words, is defined as an artificial application of water into a land or soil. The proper cultivation of crops demands an adequate supply of water: water is a very precious resource when it comes to cultivation. It assists in keeping the plants always moisturized and catalyzes the proper supply of nutrients throughout the plant. However, irrigation is a very enervating task, as it requires us to either wait for the natural method of water supply: rain or build a passage from the river to the field. However, this method of irrigation risks the vitality of the crops and the soil itself due to the high possibility of the land being flooded, the soil being eroded, and the water being wasted. Hence, to make irrigation a simpler, convenient, friendly, fun concept, we have made an “AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM”: a model for controlling irrigation facilities to help millions of people.
Nepal, a country with huge agricultural potential, lacks the technical prowess to harness this prospect. More precisely, we think it lacks “The automatic side of agriculture”. We started this project with the intention to make a system that automatically manages the irrigation side of things; hence the name, “Auto-Irrigation System”. We’ve sequestered this project into various parts and each part has its own purpose to make this project an ideal one. But we all know that this project is far from its potential. We’ve set out on a journey to constantly improve this project as we go along and we hope that it could at least reduce, if not efface the problem of manual work in the agricultural industry.

## II. Problem Statement

The economy of many countries depends on agriculture. To achieve the best quality from this research, it is important to focus on some vital characteristics such as the appropriate amount of electricity as well as water supply and a suitable schedule for irrigation of crops. Farmers are facing problems in meeting these standards, especially those living under the poverty line in DEVELOPING NATIONS.
In the context of Nepal, despite having a 69% labor force, agriculture merely contributes to about 30% of the country’s overall GDP. One of the reasons for this drastic difference in statistics is because of the farmers’ inability to attend to all their crops in time, which leads to the decline in harvest rates on a large scale: the unattended crops tend to die out because of lack of supply of nutrients. When this happens, most of the farmers opt for industrial fertilizers, thereby temporarily increasing harvest rate and permanently decreasing the quality of the soil: by increasing its acidity. 
This project looks into developing an automated irrigation system that could be controlled and monitored through a mobile application. This system shall work to minimize the number of workers in a crop field, control and save water and electricity, increase agricultural yield using small quantities of water, minimize manual intervention in watering operations with increasing watering speed, and preserve plants from fungi. All these features contribute to making this system a technological advancement in the world of manual irrigation, which is both time and effort consuming.
